        <li>
          East West collects information under the direction of our customers, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes on behalf of such customers. When we provide services to our customers, in some instances we process personal information about their clients or employees (“Client Information”) on their behalf. In these situations, it is our customers rather than we who decide the reasons for which the Client Information will be processed.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are a client or employee of one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our service or for details of how the Client Information will be used and protected, and details of how to access or correct the information, please refer to the privacy statement of the East West customer to which you submitted your personal information. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.
        </li>
        <li>
          East West acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete data should directly query East West’s customer. If requested to remove data, we will respond within the applicable legal timeframe.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed to provide services to our customers at their instruction. East West may also retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
